    "We are going to explore carbon and/or water cycling in the Earth system using Jupyter Notebooks. Before we dive into these natural processes, we first briefly explain what a Jupyter Notebook is, and how you can interact with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a Jupyter Notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter Notebook is a piece of software that allows you to write texts (like the one you are reading now!), write code, perform calculations and create figures. Jupyter Notebooks can be used for teaching, but also for scientific research (perhaps also your BSc and MSc thesis project research). For more information on Jupyter Notebooks, visit www.jupyter.org\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How does a Jupyter Notebook work?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter Notebook consists of different 'cells'. The cell that you are now reading is of the type 'Markdown'. This is text with a some basic formatting (e.g. *italic* or **boldface** text, or mathematical equations, e.g. $y = ax+b$). You can add new cells by clicking `Insert` > `Insert Cell Below`. By default, new cells are of the type 'Code', but you can change the behavior of the cell (e.g. to 'Markdown') by selecting a different type in the menu above.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can execute a piece of code by one of the following options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Select the cell containing the code and press the button 'Run' in the menu above\n",
    "- Press `ctrl` + `enter` while selecting the cell\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 1: Test Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "> Try to execute the following cell, and see whether you are able to get the expected result. Note that the line starting with the symbol `#` will be ignored by Python: this is called a 'comment'. Using comments is helpful to make your code more easily readable so that someone else is also able to understand your code"

    "\n",
    "The carbon dioxide respiration flux is the release of CO$_2$ by vegetation (autotrophic respiration) and other organisms (heterotrophic respiration). Contrary to the photosynthetic uptake of carbon through photosynthesis (the uptake of CO$_2$ by vegetation from the atmosphere), there is no light required, and respiration therefore continues day and night (usually photosynthesis dominates during day time).\n",

    "Following Flanagan and Johnson (2005), we have the following relation for terrestrial ecosystem respiration $R$ (in $\\mu mol\\ m^{-2}\\ s^{-1}$):\n",

    "$$R(T_{soil})=R_{10} \\times Q_{10}^{\\big(\\frac{T_{soil}-T_{ref}}{10}\\big)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation $T_{soil}$ is the soil temperature in &deg;$C$. The reference temperature $T_{ref}$ equals 10 &deg;$C$ and $R_{10}$ is the respiration rate (in $\\mu mol\\ m^{-2}\\ s^{-1}$) at the reference temperature. Finally, $Q_{10}$ is a coefficient that describes how sensitive the respiration is to temperature changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 2a: Plot temperature sensitivity\n",
    "\n",
    "> Here we will explore the respiration equation using the value $Q_{10}$ = 2 (see Fig. 4a in Flanagan and Johnson, 2005) and for $R_{10}$ we take 1.5 $\\mu mol\\ m^{-2}\\ s^{-1}$ (see Fig. 4b in Flanagan and Johnson, 2005; note that this number is quite uncertain). We will create a plot of the respiration $R$ as a function of soil temperatures ranging from 10 to 40 &deg;$C$. First we need to import Python libraries NumPy to do some maths (more advanced than `1+1`) and matplotlib to make a figure. "

    "Again, there are many open questions. For instance, you may wonder how a changing climate would affect transpiration rates. Global warming tends to increase transpiration rates because of larger atmospheric water demand. However, due to higher CO$_2$ concentrations in the atmosphere, plants are also able to reduce the opening of their stomates, which increases water use efficiency (WUE). These processes could all be modeled and investigated in a Jupyter Notebook environment.\n",

    "In this Notebook we explored some basic Python and Jupyter Notebook features, including defining functions and plotting figures. We also investigated the temperature sensitivity of respiration (an important process for carbon cycling) and the saturation vapor pressure, which controls transpiration rates (an important process for water cycling). You can now use the developed skills and functions for a short research assignment (see separate pdf file).\n",
